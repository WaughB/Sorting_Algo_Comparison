# Sorting_Algo_Comparison

Compares various sorting algorithms in order to showcase time efficiency benefits over other algorithms. 

## Algorithms

### Already included:
- Bubble Sort
- Quicksort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort

### Still to come:
- Select Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort

## Data Creation

The data is being self-generated with a hard-coded limit on the number of data points to evaluate. I hope to eventually included an option to create different styles of data, such as: ascending, descending, and heavy duplication. Currently, only random is available. Some algorithms perform better or worse depending on if the data is sorted, so having the option gives a better sense of performance. This may also include the option to determine the number of data points. 

I do not have the intention to allow the user to upload their own data at this time.

## Analysis

The program does not do any kind of analysis, it only reports the results of the test. Once all of the algorithms and data types are created, I may include an analysis of the results of the algorithms. This analysis woudld explore the differences in performance based on the data type and number of data points.
